# interceptor

Browser control CLI for AI agents. No CDP, no MCP, no API keys. You call `interceptor`, read the output, decide what's next.

**Binary:** `dist/interceptor`

## Start Here

```bash
interceptor open "https://example.com"        # Open, wait, return tree + text (1 command)
interceptor act e1                            # Click element, return updated tree + diff
interceptor act e2 "hello"                    # Type into field, return updated tree
interceptor read                              # Re-read current page (tree + text)
interceptor inspect                           # Tree + text + network log + headers
```

The daemon auto-starts. No setup needed.

### Legacy (still works, but prefer compound commands above)

```bash
interceptor tab new "https://example.com"    # Open managed tab
sleep 2                                # Wait for load
interceptor tree                              # See interactive elements
interceptor click e1                          # Click by ref
interceptor type e2 "hello"                   # Type into field
interceptor text                              # Read visible text
```

## Use Cases

The [`use-cases/`](use-cases/) folder is where proven browser workflows get turned into reusable documentation. When you figure out how to do something reliably on a live site, add a compact use-case there so later agents can follow the path instead of burning tokens rediscovering it.

## Compound Commands (Agent-Optimized)

These collapse multi-step patterns into single CLI invocations. Prefer these over the individual commands below.

```bash
interceptor open "https://example.com"        # tab new + wait + tree + text in one call
interceptor open "https://example.com" --tree-only   # Skip text
interceptor open "https://example.com" --text-only   # Skip tree
interceptor open "https://example.com" --full        # Full text (no 2000-char limit)
interceptor open "https://example.com" --timeout 10000  # Custom wait timeout
interceptor open "https://example.com" --no-wait     # Don't wait for load
interceptor read                              # Tree + text for current page
interceptor read e5                           # Tree + text for element subtree
interceptor read --tree-only                  # Just tree
interceptor read --text-only                  # Just text
interceptor act e5                            # Click + wait + return updated tree + diff
interceptor act e3 "hello"                    # Type + wait + return updated tree
interceptor act e5 --os                       # OS-level trusted click
interceptor act e5 --keys "Enter"             # Send keyboard shortcut instead
interceptor act e5 --no-read                  # Skip post-action tree read
interceptor inspect                           # Tree + text + net log + headers
interceptor inspect --net-only                # Just network data
interceptor inspect --filter api              # Filter network entries
```

## Reading Pages

```bash
interceptor tree                              # Interactive elements with refs (e1, e2...)
interceptor tree --filter all                 # Include headings + landmarks
interceptor text                              # All visible text
interceptor text e7                           # Text from specific element
interceptor html e5                           # HTML of element
interceptor find "Submit"                     # Find elements by name
interceptor find "Submit" --role button       # Filter by ARIA role
interceptor diff                              # What changed since last tree
interceptor state                             # DOM tree + scroll + focus (verbose)
```

## Interacting With Pages

```bash
interceptor click e5                          # Click element
interceptor click e5 --os                     # OS-level trusted click (bypasses isTrusted)
interceptor type e3 "hello"                   # Type into field (clears first)
interceptor type e3 "more" --append           # Append without clearing
interceptor select e7 "option-value"          # Select dropdown option
interceptor hover e5                          # Hover over element
interceptor keys "Enter"                      # Keyboard shortcut
interceptor keys "Control+A" --os             # OS-level keyboard
interceptor scroll down                       # Scroll
```

When a synthetic click doesn't trigger anything (React/Angular sites), interceptor auto-escalates to OS-level input. You can also force it with `--os`.

## Navigating

```bash
interceptor tab new "https://example.com"     # New tab (joins interceptor group)
interceptor navigate "https://other.com"      # Navigate current tab
interceptor tabs                              # List all tabs (* = active)
interceptor tab switch 12345                  # Switch to tab by ID
interceptor tab close                         # Close current tab
interceptor back                              # History back
interceptor forward                           # History forward
interceptor wait 2000                         # Wait milliseconds
interceptor wait-stable                       # Wait for DOM to stop changing
```

## Sniffing Network Traffic

All `fetch()` and `XMLHttpRequest` traffic is captured automatically on every page. No setup. No CDP. No debugger bar.

```bash
interceptor net log                           # All captured fetch/XHR requests
interceptor net log --filter voyager          # Filter by URL substring
interceptor net log --filter api.example.com  # See specific API calls
interceptor net log --since 1700000000000     # After timestamp
interceptor net log --limit 50                # Max entries (default 100)
interceptor net clear                         # Flush buffer
interceptor net headers                       # Request headers the page sent (CSRF tokens, auth)
interceptor net headers --filter linkedin     # Filter by URL
```

Each entry includes: `url`, `method`, `status`, `body` (full response text), `type` (fetch/xhr), `timestamp`.

### Injecting / Rewriting Requests

Override rules rewrite URLs before the page's JavaScript sends them. The page sees the modified request. The server gets the modified request. No CDP.

```bash
# Change a query parameter on matching requests
interceptor override "*eventAttending*" count=50

# Multiple params
interceptor override "*api/search*" limit=50 offset=0

# Clear overrides
interceptor override clear
```

This is how `interceptor linkedin attendees` changes LinkedIn's page size from 20→50 — the page's own JavaScript fetches attendees, but interceptor rewrites the request in-flight to ask for more results.

## SSE Stream Capture

interceptor intercepts Server-Sent Events (text/event-stream) in real-time, chunk by chunk.

```bash
interceptor sse streams                                  # List active SSE streams
interceptor sse log [--filter <pattern>] [--limit N]     # Show completed SSE streams
interceptor sse tail [--filter <pattern>]                # Live tail SSE chunks
```

Works automatically on any site using fetch-based SSE or EventSource. No CDP. No setup.

## ChatGPT Agentic Bridge

Drive ChatGPT's web UI programmatically — send prompts, read streamed responses via the API wire protocol, iterate.

```bash
interceptor chatgpt send "What is 2+2?"                  # Send and read response
interceptor chatgpt send "Write hello world" --stream     # Stream tokens live
interceptor chatgpt read                                   # Read conversation from DOM
interceptor chatgpt status                                 # Streaming state + model
interceptor chatgpt conversations                          # List recent conversations
interceptor chatgpt switch <conversation-id>               # Navigate to conversation
interceptor chatgpt stop                                   # Stop generation
```

No API keys needed. Uses your existing ChatGPT session. Auth tokens, sentinel challenges, and conduit routing are all handled by the browser automatically.

## Scene-Graph Access (Canva, Google Docs, Google Slides)

`interceptor scene` exposes editor objects by stable identifier so an agent can click, read, and write inside visual editors without screenshots or vision. Profile-driven: per-host detection picks the right resolver.

```bash
interceptor scene profile [--verbose]        # Detect host editor profile + capabilities
interceptor scene list [--type <t>]          # List scene objects (images, shapes, text, slides, pages)
interceptor scene click <id>                 # Click by stable id (Canva LB*, Slides filmstrip-slide-N-*, Docs page-N)
interceptor scene dblclick <id>              # Enter text-edit mode in Canva/Slides
interceptor scene hit <x>,<y>                # Identify object at viewport X,Y
interceptor scene selected                   # Read current selection label
interceptor scene zoom                       # Read editor zoom factor

interceptor scene text [--with-html]         # Read full document (Google Docs hidden iframe mirror)
interceptor scene insert "<text>"            # Insert at cursor (Google Docs)

interceptor scene slide list                 # All slides with stable IDs + blob URLs
interceptor scene slide current              # Current slide index + id
interceptor scene slide goto <n>             # Navigate via URL fragment
interceptor scene notes [--slide <n>]        # Read speaker notes

interceptor scene render <id> [--save]       # Render a scene object to PNG
```

**Architecture by editor:**

- **Canva** — every canvas object is a `<div id="LB…">` with `style.transform: translate(x, y)`. Stable across reloads.
- **Google Docs** — the canvas is opaque, but the full document HTML lives in `.docs-texteventtarget-iframe > [role=textbox]` with `data-ri` range offsets. `insert` uses `execCommand('insertText')` on the iframe contenteditable; writes are undoable via `interceptor keys Meta+z`.
- **Google Slides** — each slide is an SVG `<g id="filmstrip-slide-N-gd…">` with a blob-URL PNG thumbnail. `scene slide goto` sets `location.hash = "#slide=id." + pageId`. `scene render` fetches the blob and draws it into a canvas. Text-box content only appears in the text-event iframe when a text box is in edit mode — a documented caveat.

**Caveats:**
- Canva synthetic clicks require prior interactive warmup to trigger the selection state machine. Use `interceptor scene click <id> --os` when `scene selected` doesn't update.
- Google Docs canvas rendering means visual assertions must go through `interceptor scene text` (reads) or the canvas-tile `render` (pixels).
- Google Slides filmstrip thumbnails filter synthetic clicks and synthetic keys. Always use hash navigation for `slideGoto`.

## Recording Sessions

The `interceptor monitor` family records every real user click, keystroke, form change, navigation, DOM mutation, and the network calls each action triggered — then exports the trace as either a pretty timeline or a runnable `interceptor` replay script. No CDP. No infobanner.

Monitor commands (`start`, `stop`, `pause`, `resume`) auto-resolve the target tab from the interceptor group when `--tab` is omitted. If the content script port is disconnected (e.g. after a service worker restart or long SPA session), the extension automatically re-injects `content.js` and retries.

```bash
interceptor monitor start                              # Begin recording on the active interceptor tab
interceptor monitor start --instruction "..."          # Annotate with task intent
interceptor monitor stop                               # End recording, print summary
interceptor monitor status                             # Active session(s)
interceptor monitor pause                              # Stop emitting without ending
interceptor monitor resume                             # Resume a paused session
interceptor monitor list                               # All sessions in the event log
interceptor monitor tail [--raw]                       # Live tail of the current session
interceptor monitor export <sessionId>                 # Aligned text rendering
interceptor monitor export <sessionId> --json          # Raw JSONL
interceptor monitor export <sessionId> --plan          # Replay script (interceptor ... lines)
interceptor monitor export <sessionId> --plan --include-synthetic  # Include agent-driven clicks in plan
```

Event records are sparse — short keys (`t`, `s`, `k`, `sid`, `ref`, `r`, `n`, `v`, `cause`) so a 30-minute session reads in a few KB. User actions get a session-monotonic `seq`; mutations and network calls fired within 500ms of an action carry `cause: <seq>`. Real user events have `tr: true`; interceptor's own synthetic clicks have `tr: false`. The replay-plan generator automatically includes synthetic clicks when no real user events exist in the session (common when an agent drove the browser). Use `--include-synthetic` to force inclusion regardless.

The replay plan uses semantic selectors that survive DOM churn:
```
interceptor tab new "https://example.com/"
interceptor wait-stable
interceptor click "button:Search"
interceptor type "textbox:Query" "bun docs"
interceptor keys "Enter"
interceptor wait-stable
```

When the user runs the replay, interceptor's `find_and_click` / `find_and_type` re-resolves each selector against the live DOM — no stale ref problems.

The monitor stores sessions in `/tmp/interceptor-events.jsonl` (the same file `interceptor events` already tails). Sessions are delimited by `mon_start` / `mon_stop` events with the same `sid`. Multiple sessions coexist historically and `interceptor monitor list` shows them all.

## Screenshots

```bash
interceptor screenshot                        # Viewport JPEG (returns data URL)
interceptor screenshot --save                 # Save to disk as file
interceptor screenshot --full                 # Full-page scroll+stitch
interceptor screenshot --format png           # PNG format
interceptor screenshot --quality 80           # JPEG quality 0-100
interceptor screenshot --element 5            # Capture specific element
```

## LinkedIn Extraction

### Event Data (no CDP)
```bash
interceptor linkedin event "https://www.linkedin.com/events/1234567890/"
interceptor linkedin event "https://www.linkedin.com/events/1234567890/?viewAsMember=true" --wait 3000
```

Returns: title, organizer name, ISO start/end timestamps, timezone, attendee count, 250 attendee names, poster name, poster follower count, likes, reposts, comments, UGC post ID, event details text. Cross-validated against DOM.

### Attendees (no CDP)
```bash
interceptor linkedin attendees "https://www.linkedin.com/events/1234567890/"
interceptor linkedin attendees "https://www.linkedin.com/events/1234567890/" --enrich-limit 10
```

Opens Manage Attendees modal, paginates it, calls voyager API (up to 250), merges results. Automatically pushes request overrides to change page size 20→50. `--enrich-limit` controls per-attendee profile/company API enrichment (default: all, which is slow for 250+).

## Stealth

interceptor passes every major bot detection site:
- **BrowserScan**: Normal (all checks)
- **CreepJS**: 0% headless, 0% stealth
- **Fingerprint.com**: `"notDetected"`
- **Sannysoft**: All passed
- **Pixelscan**: "You're Definitely a Human"
- **AreyouHeadless**: "You are not Chrome headless"

No CDP is used for any default operation. Network capture is done by monkey-patching `fetch`/`XHR` in the page's JavaScript context — invisible to detection.

## The Interceptor Group

Every `interceptor tab new` and `interceptor window new` adds tabs to a cyan "interceptor" tab group. By default, interceptor only operates on tabs in this group — the user's personal tabs are never touched.

Pass `--any-tab` to operate on any tab.

## Flags

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--json` | JSON output instead of plain text |
| `--tab <id>` | Target specific tab by ID |
| `--any-tab` | Operate outside the interceptor group |
| `--os` | OS-level trusted input (CGEvent) |
| `--frame <id>` | Target iframe |
| `--changes` | Include DOM diff in response |

## Typical Flows

### Fill out a form
```bash
interceptor open "https://app.example.com/signup"
interceptor act e5 "user@example.com"
interceptor act e7 "password123"
interceptor act e9                            # Submit button
interceptor read                              # Read result
```

### Extract API data from an SPA
```bash
interceptor open "https://app.example.com/dashboard"
interceptor inspect --filter api              # Tree + text + API network calls + headers
```

### Monitor a page for changes
```bash
interceptor open "https://example.com/status"
# ... time passes ...
interceptor diff                              # What changed
interceptor read                              # Current state
```

### Navigate a multi-step flow
```bash
interceptor open "https://example.com"
interceptor act e12                           # Click "Next", get updated tree
interceptor act e5 "search query"             # Fill field
interceptor act e8                            # Submit
interceptor read                              # Read results
interceptor tab close
```

### Read and write a Google Doc
```bash
interceptor tab new "https://docs.google.com/document/d/<id>/edit"
sleep 5
interceptor scene profile                     # → google-docs
interceptor scene text                        # Full document text (from hidden iframe mirror)
interceptor scene text --with-html            # Include inline HTML + data-ri offsets
interceptor scene insert "hello from interceptor"    # Insert at cursor position
interceptor keys "Meta+z"                     # Undo the insert (execCommand writes are undoable)
```

### Navigate a Google Slides deck
```bash
interceptor tab new "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/<id>/edit"
sleep 6
interceptor scene slide list                  # Every slide with stable IDs + blob URLs
interceptor scene slide goto 5                # Navigate via URL fragment (synthetic clicks/keys do not work)
interceptor scene slide current               # Verify new index
interceptor scene notes                       # Read speaker notes
interceptor scene render <slide-id> --save    # Save slide as PNG
```

### Hit Canva objects by stable layer ID
```bash
interceptor tab new "https://www.canva.com/design/<id>/edit"
sleep 6
interceptor scene profile                     # → canva
interceptor scene list --type shape           # Every LB layer classified as a shape
interceptor scene hit 537,516                 # Identify what's at a viewport coordinate
interceptor scene click LBKfjtRwQHt7D0Cf      # Click by stable id
interceptor scene zoom                        # Current editor zoom factor
```

### Record a user session and replay it
```bash
interceptor monitor start --instruction "search for bun docs, open first result"
# ... user interacts for 30–60 seconds ...
interceptor monitor stop                      # Summary: evt / mut / net / nav counts + duration
interceptor monitor list                      # All sessions in /tmp/interceptor-events.jsonl
interceptor monitor export <sessionId>        # Pretty-aligned timeline
interceptor monitor export <sessionId> --plan # Replayable script (one interceptor cmd per line)
```

## What NOT to Do

- Don't use screenshots to understand pages — use `interceptor tree`, `interceptor text`, or `interceptor scene list` / `interceptor scene text`
- Don't start the daemon manually — it auto-starts on first command
- Don't chain commands without `sleep` — the extension needs time to process
- Don't interact with tabs outside the interceptor group without `--any-tab`
- Don't use `interceptor network on` (CDP) unless you specifically need raw debugger capture — it shows a yellow bar and can be detected
- Don't confuse `interceptor canvas` (HTMLCanvasElement pixel access — `list` / `read` / `diff`) with `interceptor scene` (DOM / SVG / iframe scene-graph access in visual editors)
- Don't synthetic-click Google Slides filmstrip thumbnails — use `interceptor scene slide goto <n>` which navigates via the URL fragment

interceptor storage                          # Read localStorage
interceptor eval "document.title"            # Run JS (isolated world)
interceptor eval "window.foo" --main         # Run JS (page context, awaits promises)
interceptor eval --main "fetch(url).then(r => r.json())"  # Async eval returns resolved value
interceptor history "search"                 # Search browser history
interceptor bookmarks "query"                # Search bookmarks
interceptor batch '[{"type":"click","ref":"e5"},{"type":"wait","ms":500}]'  # Batch actions
interceptor status                           # Daemon status (local check)
interceptor canvas list                      # Discover HTMLCanvasElement nodes (NOT `interceptor scene`)
interceptor canvas read 0 --format png       # Read canvas bytes as data URL

## macOS Native Control

`interceptor macos` gives agents the same structured control over native macOS applications that `interceptor` gives over the browser. No screenshots, no vision models, no coordinate guessing. Structured accessibility trees, real-time audio/speech, on-device intelligence, and OS-level trusted input.

The native bridge (`interceptor-bridge`) runs as a LaunchAgent and communicates with the daemon over Unix socket. Same CLI, same wire format, same ref system.

### Quick Start (macOS)

```bash
interceptor macos open "Finder"                  # Activate + tree + window info
interceptor macos read                           # Tree for frontmost app
interceptor macos act e5                         # Click + wait + updated tree
interceptor macos act e3 "hello"                 # Type + wait + updated tree
interceptor macos inspect                        # Tree + apps + frontmost info
```

### Accessibility (AX Tree)

```bash
interceptor macos tree                           # AX tree for frontmost app
interceptor macos tree --app "Finder"            # Specific app
interceptor macos tree --filter interactive      # Only actionable elements (default)
interceptor macos tree --depth 5                 # Limit depth
interceptor macos find "Save" --role button      # Find elements by name/role
interceptor macos inspect e5                     # All attributes + actions for ref
interceptor macos value e5                       # Read element value
interceptor macos value e5 "new text"            # Set element value
interceptor macos action e5 press                # Perform AX action
interceptor macos focused                        # Current focused element
interceptor macos windows                        # All windows with frames
interceptor macos windows --app "Finder"         # Specific app
```

Refs (`e1`, `e2`, ...) work the same as browser refs. AXObserver auto-invalidates when the tree changes.

### Apps & Windows

```bash
interceptor macos apps                           # List running apps (name, pid, bundle ID)
interceptor macos app activate "Finder"          # Bring to front
interceptor macos app hide "Finder"              # Hide
interceptor macos app quit "Finder"              # Quit
interceptor macos app launch "com.apple.finder"  # Launch by bundle ID
interceptor macos frontmost                      # Current frontmost app
interceptor macos move e1 --x 0 --y 25           # Move window
interceptor macos resize e1 --width 672 --height 983  # Resize window
```

### Input (CGEvent — OS-level trusted)

```bash
interceptor macos click e5                       # Click AX element by ref
interceptor macos click 500,300                  # Click at coordinates
interceptor macos click e5 --double              # Double-click
interceptor macos click e5 --right               # Right-click
interceptor macos type e5 "hello world"          # Focus + type
interceptor macos type "hello world"             # Type at current focus
interceptor macos keys "Meta+C"                  # Keyboard shortcut
interceptor macos scroll e5 --down 300           # Scroll
interceptor macos drag e5 e8                     # Drag between elements
```

When AX actions fail, interceptor auto-escalates to CGEvent click using the element's frame coordinates.

### Menu Traversal

```bash
interceptor macos menu                           # Frontmost app's full menu tree
interceptor macos menu --app "Finder"            # Specific app
interceptor macos menu "File" "New Folder"       # Invoke menu item by path
```

### Screen Capture (ScreenCaptureKit)

```bash
interceptor macos screenshot                     # Frontmost window
interceptor macos screenshot --app "Finder"      # Specific app
interceptor macos screenshot --save              # Save to disk
interceptor macos capture start                  # Start continuous 30fps capture
interceptor macos capture frame                  # Get latest frame
interceptor macos capture stop                   # Stop
```

### Speech & Audio

```bash
interceptor macos listen start                   # Start speech recognition
interceptor macos listen stop                    # Stop + return transcript
interceptor macos listen transcript              # Current transcript
interceptor macos listen tail                    # Poll-friendly transcript stream
interceptor macos vad start                      # Voice activity detection
interceptor macos vad status                     # Is someone speaking? + RMS level
interceptor macos sounds start                   # Sound classification (300+ types)
interceptor macos sounds status                  # Current detected sounds
interceptor macos audio output start             # Capture system audio
interceptor macos audio input start              # Capture microphone
```

### Vision & NLP (on-device)

```bash
interceptor macos vision faces                   # Detect faces in frontmost window
interceptor macos vision text                    # OCR
interceptor macos vision hands                   # Hand pose detection
interceptor macos vision bodies                  # Body pose detection
interceptor macos nlp entities "Ron in Austin"   # Named entity recognition
interceptor macos nlp sentiment "great product"  # Sentiment analysis
interceptor macos nlp language "bonjour"         # Language detection
```

### Monitor (macOS)

```bash
interceptor macos monitor start                  # Record all user interactions
interceptor macos monitor start --instruction "Show me how you file expenses"
interceptor macos monitor stop                   # Stop + summary
interceptor macos monitor tail                   # Live event stream
interceptor macos monitor export <sid>           # Pretty timeline
interceptor macos monitor export <sid> --plan    # Replayable interceptor macos script
```

Captures clicks, keystrokes, scrolls, app switches with timestamps and AX element annotations. Same sparse JSON format as browser monitor.

### Display & Streaming

```bash
interceptor macos display list                   # All displays (physical + virtual)
interceptor macos display create 1920x1080       # Create virtual display
interceptor macos display remove <id>            # Remove virtual display
interceptor macos stream start --app "Finder"    # Start screen stream
interceptor macos stream frame                   # Latest frame
interceptor macos stream fps                     # Current FPS
interceptor macos stream stop                    # Stop
```

### Other Domains

```bash
interceptor macos trust                          # Check all permissions with System Settings paths
interceptor macos clipboard read                 # Read clipboard
interceptor macos clipboard tail                 # Monitor clipboard changes
interceptor macos files watch ~/Desktop          # Watch directory for changes
interceptor macos notifications tail             # Live notification stream
interceptor macos ai prompt "Summarize this"     # On-device LLM (macOS 26+, Apple Intelligence)
```

### Typical macOS Flows

```bash
# Resize browser and open a URL
interceptor macos app activate "Brave Browser"
interceptor macos windows --app "Brave Browser"
interceptor macos move e1 --x 0 --y 25
interceptor macos resize e1 --width 672 --height 983
interceptor macos keys "Meta+t"
interceptor macos keys "Meta+l"
interceptor macos type "https://example.com"
interceptor macos keys "Return"

# Watch a user, learn the workflow, replay it
interceptor macos monitor start --instruction "file an expense"
# ... user works ...
interceptor macos monitor stop
interceptor macos monitor export <sid> --plan    # Get replayable script
```

## Development Reference

### Build
```bash
bash scripts/build.sh                  # Build extension + CLI + daemon
bash scripts/build.sh --target=macos   # macOS only
bun test                               # Run tests
```

### After code changes
```bash
bun build extension/src/background.ts --outdir=extension/dist --target=browser
bun build extension/src/content.ts --outdir=extension/dist --target=browser
bun build extension/src/inject-net.ts --outdir=extension/dist --target=browser
cp extension/manifest.json extension/dist/
interceptor reload                            # Reload extension in browser
pkill interceptor-daemon                      # Next command auto-respawns
```

### Extension install (DMG — recommended)
```bash
bash scripts/build-dmg.sh              # Build DMG installer
# Open dist/Interceptor-v0.6.0-macOS.dmg, double-click Install Interceptor
# Select browser + profile → done
```

### Extension install (manual)
```bash
bash scripts/install.sh                # macOS — native messaging manifest
```
Then load `extension/dist/` as unpacked extension in Chrome/Brave.

### Silent inject (scripted)
```bash
python3 scripts/inject.py --browser brave --profile Default \
  --extension-src extension/dist --daemon-path daemon/interceptor-daemon
```
