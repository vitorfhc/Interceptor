# Interceptor Browser

Agent-operator skill for the Browser surface of Interceptor. Use the `interceptor` CLI (no prefix) to drive a live Chrome / Brave session: pages, network, scene graph, monitor, screenshots. For native macOS apps load `interceptor-macos` instead.

This installed skill is self-contained. Source checkouts also have `AGENTS.md`, but packaged users may only have the skill directory below `/Library/Application Support/Interceptor/skills`.

## Core Rules

- Use compound commands (`open`, `read`, `act`, `inspect`) before low-level verbs.
- Browser commands operate inside managed Interceptor tab groups. Do not use `--any-tab` unless the user explicitly authorizes acting outside those groups.
- When other agents may share this browser, scope yourself with `--group <label>` on every command (or set `INTERCEPTOR_GROUP` once): your tabs live in their own colored group, resolution never leaves it, and cross-group targets are rejected. Run `interceptor group close <label>` when your job is done; `interceptor group list` shows what's running.
- `interceptor open <url>` and `interceptor tab new <url>` create background tabs by default. Only `open --activate`, `tab new --activate`, `tab switch <id>`, and `window focus <id>` intentionally move browser focus.
- If multiple browser profiles are connected, run `interceptor contexts` and pass `--context <id>`.
- Prefer structured reads (`read`, `tree`, `text`, `inspect`, `scene`) before screenshots. Open `references/screenshot-policy.md` before screenshot-heavy work.
- Default to plain text output. Use `--json` only when piping into scripts or when a downstream tool needs a machine-readable contract.
- If an already-loaded unpacked extension behaves stale after a package update, reload it from `chrome://extensions` or `brave://extensions`, or run `interceptor reload` once the extension is reachable.

## Fast Path

```bash
interceptor status                        # 1. Confirm daemon + extension are alive
interceptor open "https://example.com"    # 2. Background tab + wait + tree + text
interceptor read                          # 3. Current state (re-read after any mutation)
interceptor act e5                        # 4. Click ref e5 (refs come from `read`)
interceptor act e7 "example user"         # 5. Type into ref e7
interceptor inspect                       # 6. Tree + text + network in one read
```

Inside this repo without `interceptor` on PATH, use `./dist/interceptor ...`.

## Workflows

Each workflow is a complete self-contained "you are doing X" procedure. Open the file when the task matches.

| Workflow | When to invoke |
|---|---|
| [`workflows/verify-deploy.md`](workflows/verify-deploy.md) | "Verify the deploy", "check that X works on the page", reproducing a bug before touching code |
| [`workflows/read-and-extract.md`](workflows/read-and-extract.md) | Compound page read + SPA state extraction — pull a specific value off a page |
| [`workflows/drive-rich-editor.md`](workflows/drive-rich-editor.md) | Canva, Google Docs, Google Slides, design-tool layer manipulation — anything where DOM refs aren't enough |
| [`workflows/rich-editor-workflows.md`](workflows/rich-editor-workflows.md) | Canva shape insertion, Docs table build+fill, Slides table insert — what works natively vs the `eval --main` last mile |
| [`workflows/google-docs-fill-empty-table-cells.md`](workflows/google-docs-fill-empty-table-cells.md) | Fill empty Docs table cells with the value above (canvas caret + per-char typing + Tab) |
| [`workflows/canva-custom-size-creation.md`](workflows/canva-custom-size-creation.md) | Create a custom-size Canva design from home (normalized semantic replay) + monitor launch/handoff pattern |
| [`workflows/cook-in-canvas.md`](workflows/cook-in-canvas.md) | Draw effects/markers directly through a page's own `CanvasRenderingContext2D` (Docs/Excalidraw), pixel-verified |
| [`workflows/cook-on-top-of-pages.md`](workflows/cook-on-top-of-pages.md) | "Cook" a live page in-place — banners, HUDs, overlays that track real DOM, full-screen takeovers, over the real session |
| [`workflows/override-xhr.md`](workflows/override-xhr.md) | Mutate a request before it hits the server — change params, force a status, throttle |
| [`workflows/bypass-csp.md`](workflows/bypass-csp.md) | Run JS a page's CSP blocks — `page CSP blocks eval`, injected inline/`eval`/PoC won't run; picks ISOLATED vs `--main`, diagnoses the real CSP, uses `csp off`, verifies at the header level |
| [`workflows/capture-page-communication.md`](workflows/capture-page-communication.md) | Capture WebSocket, Beacon, and BroadcastChannel activity without CDP |
| [`workflows/record-and-replay.md`](workflows/record-and-replay.md) | Learn a real user flow, export a replay plan, run it back |
| [`workflows/screenshot-for-vlm.md`](workflows/screenshot-for-vlm.md) | Take a screenshot the model will actually understand — VLM-budgeted, WebP, on-disk |
| [`workflows/multi-page-compare.md`](workflows/multi-page-compare.md) | Compare facts across multiple pages (e.g. "who designed Python vs JavaScript") — sequential `open --text-only` per page |

## When To Switch Surfaces

If the target is **outside the page** - a native dialog, browser chrome (URL bar, profile picker), Save/Open file picker, OS notification, or any non-browser macOS app - load `interceptor-macos` instead.

If the target is an **Electron / Chromium desktop app's web contents** (Slack, VS Code, Notion, Descript, etc.), use the CDP/app reference from `interceptor-macos`: `references/cdp-app.md`.

## Do Not Default To Troubleshooting

- User wants a browser task completed → run Interceptor commands.
- User wants Interceptor fixed, installed, or explained → that's a separate task; ask before diving into repo state.
- Inside the Interceptor repo, use this skill for live browser validation, not as the primary source of repo-development instructions.
