# slop-browser

**slop-browser is a browser automation CLI that doesn't use CDP.**

Most browser automation tools (Playwright, Puppeteer, agent-browser) control Chrome through the DevTools Protocol. Every site that cares can detect this. slop takes a different approach: it's a Chrome extension that controls your actual browser from the inside. No debugger. No automation flags. No separate browser instance.

You stay logged in. You pass bot detection. Your agent sees exactly what you see.

---

The agent calls `slop` CLI commands, reads the output, decides what to do next. No MCP, no API keys.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) runtime
- Chrome or Brave browser

### Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hacker-Valley-Media/slop-browser.git
cd slop-browser
bash scripts/build.sh
```

This produces three artifacts:

| Artifact | Path |
|----------|------|
| CLI binary | `dist/slop` |
| Background daemon | `daemon/slop-daemon` |
| Chrome extension | `extension/dist/` |

### Install the CLI

Add the binary to your PATH:

```bash
cp dist/slop /usr/local/bin/
```

### Install the Chrome Extension

1. Open Chrome or Brave and navigate to `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in the top-right corner)
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select the `extension/dist/` directory from this repo
5. The slop extension icon should appear in your toolbar

### Register Native Messaging (macOS)

The CLI communicates with the extension via Chrome's native messaging protocol. Run the install script to register the manifest:

```bash
bash scripts/install.sh
```

### Verify

```bash
slop status    # Should report daemon status
```

## Development Verification

Use the verification command that matches the kind of change you made:

```bash
bun run typecheck    # Static typing across Bun host code and extension code
bun test             # Runtime tests and CLI/parser coverage
bash scripts/build.sh # Build compiled host binaries and extension bundles
```

- Run `bun run typecheck` when you change TypeScript types, runtime wiring, Chrome API usage, Bun socket usage, or any code that crosses host/extension boundaries.
- Run `bun test` when you change parser behavior, monitor/scene helpers, or any logic already covered by the repo test suite.
- Run `bash scripts/build.sh` when you need to verify the actual host binaries and extension bundles still compile.
- For changes that affect browser behavior or shared infrastructure, run all three.

## Quick Start

```bash
slop tab new "https://example.com"   # Open a managed tab
sleep 2                               # Wait for load
slop tree                             # See what's interactive
slop click e1                         # Click element by ref
slop type e2 "hello world"            # Type into a field
slop text                             # Read visible text
```

Once installed, the daemon auto-starts on first command. No manual launch needed.

## Core Concepts

**Element Refs** — `slop tree` returns elements with refs like `e1`, `e5`, `e23`. Use these to click, type, hover. Refs survive between commands until the DOM changes.

**Slop Group** — Every `slop tab new` adds tabs to a cyan "slop" group. Commands only work on tabs in this group. Your personal tabs are never touched. Use `--any-tab` to override.

**Passive Network** — All `fetch()` and `XMLHttpRequest` traffic on every page is captured automatically. No debugger, no infobanner. Query it with `slop net log`.

**Scene Graph** — Profile-driven access to visual editors that don't render to the DOM normally: Canva, Google Docs, Google Slides. Enumerate objects by stable ID, click shapes, read full document text, navigate slide decks, render pages to PNG. `slop scene` — no CDP, no vision, no screenshots needed.

**Session Monitor** — Record a user's real interactions (clicks, keystrokes, form changes, DOM mutations, network calls) as a sparse JSONL log that replays as a `slop` script. `slop monitor start` / `slop monitor stop` / `slop monitor export --plan`. Monitor auto-resolves the active slop-managed tab when called without `--tab`, and automatically re-injects the content script if the port is disconnected (common on long-lived SPA tabs).

**Stealth** — Passes all major bot detection: BrowserScan (Normal), Pixelscan ("Definitely Human"), Sannysoft (all pass), CreepJS (0% headless), Fingerprint.com (notDetected), AreyouHeadless (not headless). Zero automation fingerprint.

**Use Cases** — The [`use-cases/`](use-cases/) folder is the cookbook for workflows we have already proven in live pages. When a browser workflow is discovered or stabilized, document the exact path there so future agents can reuse it instead of rediscovering it.

## Commands

### Read the Page
```bash
slop tree                             # Interactive elements with refs
slop tree --filter all                # Include headings + landmarks
slop tree --depth 5                   # Limit tree depth
slop text                             # All visible text
slop text e5                          # Text from specific element
slop html e5                          # HTML of specific element
slop find "Submit"                    # Find elements by name
slop find "Submit" --role button      # Filter by ARIA role
slop diff                             # What changed since last tree read
slop state                            # Full DOM tree + scroll + focused element
```

### Interact
```bash
slop click e5                         # Click element
slop click e5 --os                    # OS-level trusted click (for sites checking isTrusted)
slop click e5 --at 10,20             # Click at offset within element
slop type e3 "hello"                  # Type into element (clears first)
slop type e3 "more" --append          # Append without clearing
slop type "textbox:Search" "query"    # Type using semantic selector (role:name)
slop select e7 "option-value"         # Select dropdown option
slop hover e5                         # Hover over element
slop keys "Control+A"                 # Keyboard shortcut
slop keys "Enter" --os               # OS-level key event
slop focus e5                         # Focus element
slop drag e5 --from 0,0 --to 100,50  # Drag gesture
slop dblclick e5                      # Double-click
slop rightclick e5                    # Right-click (context menu)
```

### Navigate
```bash
slop tab new "https://example.com"    # New tab in slop group
slop navigate "https://example.com"   # Navigate current tab
slop back                             # History back
slop forward                          # History forward
slop scroll down                      # Scroll (up/down/top/bottom)
slop wait 2000                        # Wait milliseconds
slop wait-stable                      # Wait for DOM to stop changing
```

### Tabs
```bash
slop tabs                             # List all tabs (* = active)
slop tab new "https://example.com"    # Open new tab
slop tab switch 12345                 # Switch to tab by ID
slop tab close                        # Close current tab
slop tab close 12345                  # Close specific tab
slop window new "https://example.com" # New window
slop window list                      # List all windows
```

### Network — Passive Capture (always on)
Every page's fetch/XHR traffic is intercepted automatically. Full response bodies included.
```bash
slop net log                          # All captured traffic
slop net log --filter voyager         # Filter by URL substring
slop net log --filter api.example.com # Any URL pattern
slop net log --since 1700000000000    # After timestamp
slop net log --limit 50              # Max entries (default 100)
slop net clear                        # Flush buffer
slop net headers                      # Captured request headers (CSRF, auth tokens)
slop net headers --filter linkedin    # Filter by URL
```

### Network — Request Overrides (rewrite before send)
Modify outgoing requests at the JavaScript level. No CDP, no debugger.
```bash
# Change a query parameter on matching URLs
slop raw '{"type":"net_override_set","rules":[{"urlPattern":"*eventAttending*","queryAddOrReplace":{"count":50}}]}'

# Clear all overrides
slop raw '{"type":"net_override_clear"}'
```

### SSE Stream Capture

slop intercepts Server-Sent Events (text/event-stream) in real-time, chunk by chunk.

```bash
slop sse streams                                  # List active SSE streams
slop sse log [--filter <pattern>] [--limit N]     # Show completed SSE streams
slop sse tail [--filter <pattern>]                # Live tail SSE chunks
```

Works automatically on any site using fetch-based SSE or EventSource. No CDP. No setup.

### ChatGPT Agentic Bridge

Drive ChatGPT's web UI programmatically — send prompts, read streamed responses via the API wire protocol, iterate.

```bash
slop chatgpt send "What is 2+2?"                  # Send and read response
slop chatgpt send "Write hello world" --stream     # Stream tokens live
slop chatgpt read                                   # Read conversation from DOM
slop chatgpt status                                 # Streaming state + model
slop chatgpt conversations                          # List recent conversations
slop chatgpt switch <conversation-id>               # Navigate to conversation
slop chatgpt stop                                   # Stop generation
```

No API keys needed. Uses your existing ChatGPT session. Auth tokens, sentinel challenges, and conduit routing are all handled by the browser automatically.

### Scene Graph (Canva, Google Docs, Google Slides)
Read and manipulate visual editors whose "canvas" is actually a DOM / SVG / hidden-iframe structure. No CDP, no debugger, no detection risk. Profile-driven — each editor has its own detection and capability set. Works today on canva.com/design/, docs.google.com/document/, and docs.google.com/presentation/.

```bash
slop scene profile                     # Detect active editor profile
slop scene profile --verbose           # Include capabilities list
slop scene list                        # Enumerate scene objects on current page
slop scene list --type shape           # Filter by type (image|shape|text|page|slide|embed)
slop scene click <id>                  # Click a scene object by stable id (Canva: LBxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)
slop scene dblclick <id>               # Double-click to enter text edit
slop scene hit <x>,<y>                 # Identify the scene object at viewport coordinates
slop scene selected                    # Read current selection (host-aware)
slop scene zoom                        # Read editor zoom factor

slop scene text                        # Read full document text (Google Docs hidden iframe mirror)
slop scene text --with-html            # Include inline HTML with data-ri offsets
slop scene insert "<text>"             # Insert text at cursor position (Google Docs)

slop scene slide list                  # List all slides in a Google Slides deck
slop scene slide current               # Show current slide index and id
slop scene slide goto <n>              # Navigate to slide <n> (URL fragment method)
slop scene slide <n>                   # Shorthand for slide goto <n>
slop scene notes                       # Read speaker notes of current slide

slop scene render <id>                 # Render a scene object as PNG data URL
slop scene render <id> --save          # Save the PNG to disk
```

**How it works per editor:**

- **Canva**: every object on the canvas is a `<div id="LB…">` with `style.transform: translate(x, y)` and `style.width/height`. The IDs are stable per-document (they survive page reloads). `scene list` enumerates them; `scene click` computes the viewport center from `getBoundingClientRect()` and dispatches a click through `elementFromPoint`.
- **Google Docs**: the page is rendered to `<canvas>` but the full document HTML lives inside a hidden iframe at `.docs-texteventtarget-iframe > [role=textbox]`, complete with `<p>` / `<span>` elements carrying `data-ri` range-index offsets. `scene text` reads it, `scene insert` writes via `document.execCommand('insertText')` on the iframe's contenteditable.
- **Google Slides**: each slide is a SVG `<g id="filmstrip-slide-N-gd…">` with a pre-rendered PNG blob URL on the child `<image>`. The real slide-navigation page ID lives on the `data-slide-page-id` attribute of the parent `.punch-filmstrip-thumbnail`. `scene slide goto` navigates by setting `window.location.hash = "#slide=id." + pageId`.

### Recording (Session Monitor)
Record every real user click, keystroke, form change, navigation, DOM mutation, and the network calls each action triggered — then export the trace as either a pretty timeline or a runnable `slop` replay script. No CDP, no infobanner, no detection.

Monitor commands (`start`, `stop`, `pause`, `resume`) auto-resolve the target tab from the slop group when `--tab` is omitted. If the content script port is disconnected (e.g. after a service worker restart or long SPA session), the extension automatically re-injects `content.js` and retries — no `slop reload` needed.

```bash
slop monitor start                              # Begin recording on the active slop tab
slop monitor start --instruction "..."          # Annotate with task intent
slop monitor stop                               # End recording, print summary
slop monitor status                             # Show active session(s)
slop monitor pause                              # Stop emitting events without ending
slop monitor resume                             # Resume a paused session
slop monitor list                               # All sessions in the event log
slop monitor tail                               # Live tail current session (pretty)
slop monitor tail --raw                         # Live tail (raw JSONL)
slop monitor export <sessionId>                 # Aligned text rendering
slop monitor export <sessionId> --json          # Raw JSONL for that session
slop monitor export <sessionId> --plan          # Emit slop ... replay script
```

Each event line is sparse JSON (short keys: `t`, `s`, `k`, `sid`, `ref`, `r`, `n`, `cause`) so an agent can read a 30-minute session in a few KB. User actions get a session-monotonic `seq`; mutations and network calls fired within 500ms of an action carry `cause: <action_seq>`. Real user events have `tr: true`; slop's own synthetic clicks have `tr: false` so the replay generator can ignore them.

The replay script uses the existing semantic-selector path:
```
slop tab new "https://example.com/"
slop wait-stable
slop click "button:Search"
slop type "textbox:Query" "bun docs"
slop keys "Enter"
slop wait-stable
```

### Screenshots
```bash
slop screenshot                       # Viewport JPEG (returns data URL)
slop screenshot --save                # Save to disk
slop screenshot --full                # Full-page scroll+stitch
slop screenshot --format png          # PNG format
slop screenshot --quality 80          # JPEG quality 0-100
slop screenshot --element 5           # Capture element bounding box
```

### Data
```bash
slop cookies example.com              # List cookies for domain
slop storage                          # Read localStorage
slop storage set key value            # Write localStorage
slop eval "document.title"            # Run JS in page
slop history "search term"            # Search browser history
slop bookmarks "query"                # Search bookmarks
```

### LinkedIn
```bash
slop linkedin event <url>             # Full event extraction (no CDP)
slop linkedin event <url> --wait 3000 # Extra wait for slow pages
slop linkedin attendees <url>         # Attendees with request overrides + modal + API
slop linkedin attendees <url> --enrich-limit 5  # Limit per-attendee enrichment
```

### Batch & Raw
```bash
slop batch '[{"type":"click","ref":"e5"},{"type":"wait","ms":500},{"type":"extract_text"}]'
slop batch '...' --stop-on-error      # Halt on first failure
slop raw '{"type":"any_action","key":"value"}'  # Send any raw action
```

### Meta
```bash
slop status                           # Daemon status (local check, no connection needed)
slop help                             # Full CLI help
slop reload                           # Reload extension
slop capabilities                     # Check available input layers
```

## Flags

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--json` | JSON output instead of plain text |
| `--tab <id>` | Target specific tab by ID |
| `--any-tab` | Operate outside the slop group |
| `--os` | Use OS-level trusted events (macOS CGEvent) |
| `--frame <id>` | Target specific iframe |
| `--changes` | Include DOM diff in response |

## Recipes

### Extract data from an SPA
```bash
slop tab new "https://app.example.com"
sleep 3
slop tree                              # Find the data
slop net log --filter api              # See what API calls the page made
slop net headers --filter api          # Grab auth tokens from captured headers
slop text                              # Read visible content
slop tab close
```

### Fill and submit a form
```bash
slop tab new "https://example.com/form"
sleep 2
slop tree                              # Find form fields
slop type e3 "John Doe"               # Fill name
slop type e5 "john@example.com"       # Fill email
slop select e7 "option2"              # Pick dropdown
slop click e10                         # Submit
sleep 2
slop text                              # Read result
```

### Monitor network traffic from any page
```bash
slop tab new "https://app.example.com"
sleep 3
slop net log --filter api              # See all API calls with full response bodies
slop net headers --filter api          # See request headers (auth, CSRF, cookies)
# Navigate around — capture keeps running
slop click e5
sleep 2
slop net log --filter api --limit 5    # See latest calls
```

### Override API requests (change page size, params)
```bash
slop tab new "https://app.example.com"
sleep 2
# Push override: change page_size to 100 on any matching URL
slop raw '{"type":"net_override_set","rules":[{"urlPattern":"*api/list*","queryAddOrReplace":{"page_size":100}}]}'
# Now interact — when the page fetches, the URL is rewritten before it fires
slop click e5                          # Trigger a load
sleep 2
slop net log --filter api/list         # See the rewritten request + response
slop raw '{"type":"net_override_clear"}'  # Clean up
```

### LinkedIn event extraction (full flow, no CDP)
```bash
slop linkedin event "https://www.linkedin.com/events/1234567890/?viewAsMember=true"
# Returns: title, organizer, ISO dates, timezone, attendee count + names,
#          poster name, follower count, likes, reposts, comments, UGC post ID,
#          details text, thumbnail URL, validation checks
```

### Interact with sites that check isTrusted
```bash
slop tab new "https://strict-site.com"
sleep 2
slop tree
slop click e5 --os                     # OS-level CGEvent click (genuinely trusted)
slop type e3 "text" --os               # OS-level keystrokes
```

### Read a Google Doc programmatically
```bash
slop tab new "https://docs.google.com/document/d/<id>/edit"
sleep 5
slop scene profile                     # -> google-docs
slop scene text                        # Full document text from hidden iframe mirror
slop scene text --with-html            # Full HTML model with data-ri offsets
slop scene insert "new paragraph at cursor"
slop keys "Meta+z"                     # Undo the insert
```

### Manipulate a Canva design
```bash
slop tab new "https://www.canva.com/design/<id>/edit"
sleep 6
slop scene profile                     # -> canva
slop scene list --type shape           # Every LB layer that's a shape
slop scene zoom                        # Current editor zoom factor
slop scene hit 537,516                 # What's at this viewport coord?
slop scene click LBKfjtRwQHt7D0Cf      # Click a layer by stable id
```

### Navigate and render Google Slides
```bash
slop tab new "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/<id>/edit"
sleep 6
slop scene slide list                  # All slides with stable IDs + blob URLs
slop scene slide goto 5                # Navigate via URL fragment
slop scene slide current               # Verify index 5 is now active
slop scene notes                       # Read speaker notes for current slide
slop scene render filmstrip-slide-3-gd02e148143_0_6 --save  # PNG of slide 3
```

### Record a user session and replay it
```bash
# With Ron at the keyboard:
slop monitor start --instruction "search bun docs, open first result, copy paragraph"
# ... Ron interacts for 60 seconds ...
slop monitor stop                      # Prints session summary
slop monitor list                      # Shows all historical sessions
slop monitor export <sessionId>        # Aligned text rendering
slop monitor export <sessionId> --plan # Replayable script of slop commands
```

### Diff canvas pixels between two renders (the OTHER `slop canvas`)
```bash
slop canvas list                       # Discover <canvas> elements (HTMLCanvasElement)
slop canvas read 0 --format png        # Read canvas as data URL
slop canvas diff url1.png url2.png     # Pixel diff between images
```

## What NOT to Do

- **Don't take screenshots to understand a page** — use `slop tree` and `slop text`. Screenshots waste tokens.
- **Don't chain commands without sleep** — the extension needs time to process. `sleep 1` between actions.
- **Don't interact with tabs outside the slop group** without `--any-tab`.
- **Don't use CDP commands** (`slop network on`) unless you have a specific reason. Passive capture (`slop net log`) sees everything without the debugger infobanner.
- **Don't start the daemon manually** — it auto-starts on first command.
