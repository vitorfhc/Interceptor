# Browser Command Catalog

Full surface for `interceptor` (no prefix). Reference doc — load when you need flag-level detail. For task procedures, see `workflows/`. For the input-layer routing rules, see `browser-and-network.md`.

## Open + Read

```bash
interceptor open <url>                             # Open + wait + tree + text
interceptor open <url> --full | --tree-only | --text-only
interceptor open <url> --timeout 15000
interceptor open <url> --reuse                     # Navigate latest Interceptor-group tab instead of creating

interceptor read                                   # Current page tree + text
interceptor read e12 [--tree-only | --text-only]   # Scoped sub-tree
interceptor read --markdown [--text-only]          # Page text rendered as markdown (preserves headings, **bold**, lists, tables)
interceptor read --include-style
interceptor read --include-frames                  # Descend into iframes
interceptor read e2_7 --include-frames --tree-only # Framed ref
interceptor text --markdown                        # Standalone markdown dump
interceptor text e12 --markdown                    # Element rendered as markdown
```

`--reuse` for long automation — without it, dead tabs accumulate. Reading strategy: start with `read`/`open`, not a screenshot. Re-read after every mutating action.

**`--markdown` is a SWAP for `--text-only`, not an extra command.** It renders the same content with structure preserved (`<strong>` → `**bold**`, `<h1-6>` → `#`/`##`/..., lists, tables). Use it *instead of* plain `--text-only` when the task asks for the "exact text" / "exact summary" of a section, or the page has visually emphasized text near plain descriptive copy — markdown lets you tell the real answer from decoy or instructional prose. **Never run both modes** — pick one and commit. Skip markdown for raw fact lookups (single date, name, number) where flat text is enough.

## Find + Act

```bash
interceptor find "Submit"
interceptor find "Email" --role textbox

interceptor act e7                                 # Click + read after
interceptor act e9 "example user"                  # Type into field
interceptor act e11 --keys "Enter"
interceptor act e15 --trusted                      # HID-sourced click; page sees isTrusted: true. ESCALATION ONLY.
interceptor act e20 --no-read
```

**After `act --trusted` reports success, read the page once and commit.** Do not re-execute the same click via a different surface (`interceptor macos click ...`, manual coordinates, etc.) to "verify" — the page's own state is the verification, and the trusted event is the same trusted event regardless of which surface posted it. Escalating to a different surface to redo a successful browser action is the most common way to blow the command budget. `interceptor macos` remains the right surface for native-app tasks; this rule only constrains within-task redo behavior on the browser.

`find` uses semantic + text matching — faster than scanning a big tree. Low-level actions when `act` is not enough:

```bash
interceptor click e7
interceptor type e9 "..."
interceptor keys "Meta+K"
interceptor select e12 "Option label"
interceptor hover e3 | drag e4 e8 | dblclick e5 | rightclick e5
```

## Inspection + Network

```bash
interceptor inspect                                # Tree + text + passive network
interceptor inspect --net-only
interceptor inspect --filter api
```

Passive network (preferred over CDP):

```bash
interceptor net log [--filter <p>] [--since 30s] [--limit 100]
interceptor net log --format json|har|pcapng [--out <path>]
interceptor net headers [--filter <p>]
interceptor net clear
```

Overrides (declarativeNetRequest — no debugger banner):

```bash
interceptor override "*api/search*" status=500
interceptor override "*api/search*" delay=1000
interceptor override "*api/search*" status=200 body='{"results":[]}'
interceptor override clear
```

CDP only when passive `net` is insufficient:

```bash
interceptor network on | log | off
interceptor network override "*api*" status=500
```

SSE:

```bash
interceptor sse streams | log | tail
```

Page communication (WebSocket / Beacon / BroadcastChannel, no CDP):

```bash
interceptor net page-comm log [--type ws|beacon|broadcast] [--filter <text>] [--limit 100]
interceptor net page-comm clear
interceptor net monitor on [--reload] [--filter "https://example.com/*"]
interceptor net monitor status
interceptor net monitor off
```

Use `net monitor on --reload` when the WebSocket or BroadcastChannel is created
during page startup. For mechanics and limits, see `page-communication-capture.md`.

## Byte Export

Save page-produced bytes without CDP, browser downloads, Save dialogs, or
clipboard:

```bash
interceptor save --json --context <ctx> --tab <id> --out /abs/path/file.bin "window.someBlobOrUint8Array"
interceptor save --json --context <ctx> --tab <id> --out /abs/path/file.bin "blob:https://example.com/..."
interceptor save --json --context <ctx> --tab <id> --out /abs/path/file.txt "new Blob([text], {type:'text/plain'})"
```

Supported expression results: `Blob`, `File`, `ArrayBuffer`, typed arrays,
`blob:` URL strings, and objects with `url`/`blobUrl`/`href`. Use an absolute
output path (the sink writes anywhere the daemon's user can write).

`save` must be the **first token** so the CLI auto-selects the WebSocket sink
path. Other flags (`--json`, `--context`, `--tab`, `--isolated`, `--chunk-size`)
may now appear in any position — the parser keeps them out of the evaluated
expression. The response includes `sha256`, `bytes`, and `chunks`; the daemon
discards the file and fails if the written byte count doesn't match the source,
so a reported success is integrity-checked. Strict-CSP / Trusted-Types pages
work too — `save` reuses the same CSP-strip + reload bypass as `eval`.

## Canvas

```bash
interceptor canvas list | status | model | routes
interceptor canvas log [N] [--kind fillText]
interceptor canvas objects [N] [--kind text]
```

Pixels only when observer data is insufficient:

```bash
interceptor canvas read 1 [--format png] [--region 10,20,300,120] [--webgl]
interceptor canvas diff 1
interceptor canvas ocr 1                           # Native canvas text: aria/fallback + semantic model (no pixel OCR)
```

`canvas ocr` returns the canvas's *native* accessible text (aria-label / aria-labelledby / fallback subtree / figcaption) plus the page's semantic textbox model — no pixel OCR. For a canvas-rendered editor prefer `scene text`; for genuine pixel-only text use `interceptor macos vision text` (native macOS Vision OCR).

Canvas indexes are DOM canvas indexes.

## Scene (rich editors)

For Canva, Google Docs/Slides/Sheets. Run `scene profile` first.

```bash
interceptor scene profile [--verbose]
interceptor scene list [--type text]
interceptor scene hit 400 300
interceptor scene click | dblclick | select | cursor-to <scene-ref>
interceptor scene selected
interceptor scene text <scene-ref> [--with-html]
interceptor scene insert "New text"

interceptor scene slide list | current | goto 3
interceptor scene notes | render | zoom 100
```

For canvas-rendered editor input and camera apps, see `rich-editors.md`.

## Navigation + Tabs

```bash
interceptor navigate <url>
interceptor back
interceptor forward
interceptor scroll down
interceptor wait 1000
interceptor wait-stable

interceptor tabs
interceptor tab new <url>             # Background tab in the interceptor group
interceptor tab new <url> --activate  # Explicit foregrounding
interceptor tab switch <tab-id>
interceptor tab close <tab-id>

interceptor open <url> --group <label>   # Open into a named per-agent group "<brand>-<label>" (created on first use)
interceptor read --group <label>         # Any command scopes to that group's tabs; env INTERCEPTOR_GROUP is the fallback
interceptor group list                   # All live tab groups: label, title, color, tab count
interceptor group close <label>          # Atomically close every tab in a named group (other groups untouched)
interceptor window list
interceptor window new
interceptor window focus <window-id>                      # Explicit focus move
interceptor window resize <window-id> <width> <height>
interceptor window resize <window-id> --left 0 --top 0 --width 960 --height 1080
interceptor window resize --state maximized               # Don't combine maximized/fullscreen/minimized with geometry
```

Use `--tab <id>` for a specific tab; `--any-tab` only when explicitly authorized.

When several agents share one browser context, give each its own `--group <label>` (or set `INTERCEPTOR_GROUP` once per agent): every command then resolves and acts only within that agent's tab group, `--reuse` reuses only that group's tabs, and cross-group targets are rejected. Labels match `[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,32}`; pick a color with `--group-color <grey|blue|red|yellow|green|pink|purple|cyan|orange>` on first open. Close your group when the job is done.

## Cookies / Storage / History / Bookmarks

```bash
interceptor cookies example.com
interceptor cookies set '{"url":"https://example.com","name":"sid","value":"..."}'
interceptor cookies delete https://example.com sid

interceptor storage <key>
interceptor storage set <key> <value>
interceptor storage delete <key>
interceptor storage <key> --session                # sessionStorage instead

interceptor history "search term"
interceptor bookmarks "query"
interceptor bookmarks tree
```

## Headers

Tab-scoped request-header rewrites:

```bash
interceptor headers add x-debug 1
interceptor headers remove x-debug
interceptor headers clear
```

## Batch + Raw

```bash
interceptor batch '[{"type":"click","ref":"e5"},{"type":"wait","ms":500},{"type":"extract_text"}]'
interceptor batch '<json>' --stop-on-error
interceptor batch '<json>' --timeout 30000

interceptor raw '{"type":"any_action","key":"value"}'
```

`raw` sends any action verbatim — prefer named commands first.

## Contexts (multi-browser isolation)

```bash
interceptor contexts                                # List IDs of all connected browser contexts
interceptor --context <id> read                     # Route command to a specific profile
interceptor --context <id> open <url>
interceptor --context <id> act e7 "value"
```

Each browser profile auto-generates a stable UUID on first run (stored in `chrome.storage.local`). `contexts` lists all currently connected IDs. Without `--context`, commands auto-route only when exactly one context is connected; zero or multiple connected contexts fail fast and require `--context <id>`.

Primary use case: two Chrome profiles logged in to different accounts simultaneously (cross-account security testing, multi-tenant verification).

## Capabilities + Reload

```bash
interceptor capabilities                            # Available input layers
interceptor reload                                  # After extension changes during dev
```

## Branding (white-label)

```bash
interceptor brand tab-group --title "Acme"                # Rename the managed tab group at runtime
interceptor brand tab-group --title "Acme" --color blue   # Title + color (grey|blue|red|yellow|green|pink|purple|cyan|orange)
```

Runtime-configurable — no rebuild, no options page. Resolved from `chrome.storage` (precedence `managed` > `local` > built-in default `interceptor`/`cyan`) and applied live to the tab-strip group. Settable here, from the toolbar popup, or via an enterprise managed policy.

## Eval (escape hatch)

```bash
interceptor eval --main "document.title"
interceptor eval --main "window.__APP_STATE__"
```

Use only when no built-in command exposes what you need. On strict-CSP sites the first `eval --main` triggers an automatic reload/retry (the reactive CSP strip). To make page-origin JS run reliably up front — inline `<script>` injection, an XSS/PoC payload, repeated evals without the per-call reload dance — strip CSP explicitly first with `csp off` (below).

**Hit `error: page CSP blocks eval`?** That is the *default ISOLATED world* being blocked by the **extension's own** content-script CSP (`script-src 'self' 'wasm-unsafe-eval'`, no `unsafe-eval`) — NOT the page's CSP, so `csp off` will not fix it. Add `--main` to run in the page world (where the page CSP applies, and the reactive strip / `csp off` handle it). Full playbook: `workflows/bypass-csp.md`.

## CSP (disable Content-Security-Policy)

Browser-global toggle that removes CSP so injected page-origin JS runs even when `script-src` would block inline / `eval` code. Affects **every tab** — the ones already open and any opened later.

```bash
interceptor csp off                 # disable CSP on all tabs, then reload open tabs so it's live
interceptor csp on                  # re-enable CSP on all tabs (reloads open tabs)
interceptor csp status              # → "csp: disabled (all tabs)" | "csp: enabled (all tabs)"
interceptor csp off --no-reload     # toggle without reloading; each tab applies it on its next navigation
```

- **Mechanism:** one `declarativeNetRequest` session rule (no tab scope) that removes the `content-security-policy` and `content-security-policy-report-only` **response headers** — no `chrome.debugger`, no debugging banner.
- **Scope:** all tabs, current and future. New tabs and later navigations are covered automatically; no per-tab setup.
- **Lifetime:** session only (cleared on browser restart) — a global "CSP off" never silently persists across restarts.
- **Reload:** `off`/`on` reload every open http/https tab by default so already-loaded pages go live immediately; `--no-reload` skips the reloads (each tab then applies the change on its next navigation).
- **Limitation:** removes header-delivered CSP only, not a `<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy">` tag baked into the HTML.
- `disable`/`enable` are accepted as aliases for `off`/`on`.

## Output mode

Output is plain text by default — that is the format the LLM consumes. Use `--json` only when piping into a script or another tool that needs a machine-parseable contract. Structured JSON costs more tokens and reduces comprehension on prose-trained models.
